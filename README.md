# fluid-solver
The attempt to implement the HLL scheme was unsuccessful. As the framework of the function was the same as that of the Laxâ€“Friedrichs scheme, I assume the error arose from a misunderstanding of how to compute the flux. Had the implementation been successful and produced the correct plot, we would expect the HLL scheme to provide a more accurate representation of the shock, as it is a more sophisticated Riemann solver. The plots show that brute force yields results closer to the true shock profile.
