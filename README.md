# fluid-solver
The attempt to implement the HLL scheme was unsuccessful. As the framework of the function was the same as the Laxâ€“Friedrichs scheme, I assume the error has arisen from a misunderstanding on how to compute the flux. Should the implementation have been successful (produce the correct plot), we would expect the HLL scheme to give a more accurate representation of the shock as it is a more complicated Riemann solver. Plots show that brute force brings us closer to the true shock profile.
